## Description
Generic Science tools for Manim. Currently include a Table drawing script, a crude model of Thomson's Atom, and some shading utilities.

Instructions for use:
1. Clone the folder into the same directory housing your Manim projects / place the cloned folder inside the manim folder,(at the same level as the manimlib folder) wherever you installed Manim to.
2. Add `from sanim.<folder the tool's file is in>.<script enabling the feature>` to your imports.
3. Use as required.

> Note:
The master branch of the repository is compatible with, and only with the ManimCommunity branch of Manim.
Check out the manim-3b1b branch if you are using that version.
